## About
Google Foobar is a set of programming challenges triggered to the user through certain keywords in Google search. You would be given a time duration to complete each task, ranging from several days to weeks, according to the difficulty level. 
Before proceeding to the next task, each solution has to pass a set of test cases(including hidden ones) and can be written in either Java or Python. 

There are a total of 5 levels with ascending levels of difficulty. The following are some of the tasks posed:
